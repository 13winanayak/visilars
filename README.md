The goal of this project is to help students find teachers at the last moment when they need urgent guidance.
Currently, many online platforms in India offer teachers, but they require students to purchase long-term courses,
which is not always convenient.
My platform solves this issue by allowing students to connect with teachers for short-term sessions at a minimal fee.
I built this project using Java, Spring Boot, JWT, Hibernate, and other technologies.
The platform's main responsibility is to provide experienced and reliable teachers based on students' specific needs and requirements.
This is a solo project, and I have handled everything from development to implementation.
